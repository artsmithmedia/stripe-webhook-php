Webhook-Mailer: A simple example of using Stripe webhooks in PHP
----------------------------------------------------------------

This example was built on dotCloud, modified from the original https://github.com/boucher/stripe-webhook-mailer.

The app sends an email anytime an charge.payment_succeeded or invoice.payment_succeeded Stripe event webhook is received. 

To deploy on dotCloud:

1. Create a new dotCloud app
    dotCloud create <APP_NAME>
    
2. Set up mailgun account information in dotcloud.yml

3. Add your stripe api key to your php file
	https://manage.stripe.com/#account/apikeys

4. Add your webhook url to your stripe dashboard
	https://manage.stripe.com/#account/webhooks

5. Customize your email body

6. Deploy your app to dotCloud by 
    dotCloud push <APP_NAME> <DIRECTORY_TO_APP_ROOT>
